# PRD to Application Development Skill

Autonomous PRD-driven development that reads, understands, and implements applications with minimal user input. Use when user shares a PRD document, mentions "PRD", "product requirements", "spec document", or wants to build an application from requirements. This skill proactively extracts context, makes intelligent decisions, and drives development forward without requiring constant guidance.

---

## Core Philosophy

**You are a senior developer who just received a PRD.** Act like one:
- Read the entire PRD thoroughly before asking questions
- Make intelligent assumptions based on industry standards
- Only ask questions for truly ambiguous critical decisions
- Default to best practices when details are missing
- Drive development forward, don't wait for hand-holding

---

## Phase 1: PRD Intelligence (Auto-Execute)

When a PRD is shared, IMMEDIATELY and SILENTLY:

### 1.1 Deep Analysis
```
Extract and internalize:
├── Product Vision: What problem does this solve?
├── Target Users: Who will use this?
├── Core Features: What MUST it do? (MVP)
├── Nice-to-Have: What can wait?
├── Technical Hints: Any tech mentioned?
├── Constraints: Budget, timeline, platform hints?
├── Success Metrics: How is success measured?
└── Domain Context: Industry-specific requirements?
```

### 1.2 Intelligent Gap Filling

**DO NOT ask the user about these - decide intelligently:**

| Missing Info | Smart Default |
|--------------|---------------|
| Tech stack not specified | Match existing project OR use Next.js + Supabase |
| Auth method unclear | Use Supabase Auth with email/password + OAuth |
| Database design missing | Derive from features, normalize to 3NF |
| UI framework not mentioned | Shadcn/UI + Tailwind (match project) |
| API style not specified | REST for simple, tRPC for complex |
| State management unclear | React Query for server state, Zustand for client |
| No deployment target | Vercel for Next.js, Supabase for backend |

### 1.3 Context Detection

Automatically scan the current project:
```bash
# Detect existing patterns
- Check package.json for tech stack
- Check existing components for UI patterns
- Check services/ for data layer patterns
- Check types/ for typing conventions
- Match existing code style and architecture
```

---

## Phase 2: Architecture Decision (Present to User)

After analysis, present a CONCISE summary:

```markdown
## PRD Analysis Complete

**I understood this as:** [1-2 sentence summary]

**Core Features I'll Build:**
1. [Feature] - [brief description]
2. [Feature] - [brief description]
...

**Tech Approach:**
- Frontend: [choice + why]
- Backend: [choice + why]
- Database: [key tables]

**I'll start with:** [First milestone]

Say "go" to start, or clarify anything above.
```

**Keep it SHORT. Don't list every detail - you're the expert.**

---

## Phase 3: Autonomous Development

### 3.1 Development Flow

```
For each feature:
├── 1. Create types/interfaces first
├── 2. Design database schema (if needed)
├── 3. Build service layer
├── 4. Create React hooks
├── 5. Build UI components
├── 6. Wire up pages/routes
├── 7. Test basic flows
└── 8. Move to next feature
```

### 3.2 Decision Making Rules

**Make the decision yourself when:**
- Multiple valid approaches exist (pick the simpler one)
- UI layout options (follow existing patterns or best practices)
- Component structure (follow project conventions)
- Naming conventions (match existing code)
- Error handling patterns (use project's pattern or standard try/catch)

**Only ask user when:**
- Business logic is genuinely ambiguous
- PRD has contradictory requirements
- Critical security/compliance decisions
- Major architectural pivot needed

### 3.3 Progress Communication

Use TodoWrite to track progress. Give brief updates:
```
✅ User authentication complete
🔄 Building dashboard... (3/7 components done)
```

Don't explain every line of code. Just build.

---

## Phase 4: Smart Assumptions Database

When PRD mentions... | Implement as...
--------------------|----------------
"users can login" | Email/password + Google OAuth, session management
"admin panel" | Role-based access, separate admin routes
"dashboard" | Summary cards, recent activity, quick actions
"reports" | Filterable tables, CSV export, date ranges
"notifications" | Toast for in-app, optional email integration
"search" | Debounced search, fuzzy matching if data is large
"real-time" | Supabase realtime subscriptions
"file upload" | Supabase storage, image optimization
"payment" | Stripe integration stub (user configures keys)
"mobile-friendly" | Mobile-first responsive, bottom nav pattern
"offline support" | Service worker + IndexedDB queue

---

## Phase 5: When Stuck or Blocked

### 5.1 Missing Information Strategy

```
IF critical_info_missing:
  1. Check if PRD implies it elsewhere
  2. Check industry standards for this type of app
  3. Check existing project patterns
  4. Make reasonable assumption and DOCUMENT it
  5. Only ask if truly cannot proceed
```

### 5.2 Technical Blockers

```
IF technical_issue:
  1. Try standard solution first
  2. Check project's existing solutions
  3. Implement workaround if minor
  4. Flag to user only if blocking progress
```

---

## Phase 6: Output Standards

### Code Quality (Non-Negotiable)
- TypeScript with proper types (no `any`)
- Error boundaries and loading states
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Accessible (semantic HTML, ARIA where needed)
- Match existing project style exactly

### Documentation (Minimal, Useful)
- README only if new major feature
- Inline comments only for complex logic
- No excessive JSDoc

---

## Quick Start Commands

When user provides PRD:

```
1. READ entire PRD (use Read tool)
2. ANALYZE using Phase 1 framework
3. PRESENT brief summary (Phase 2)
4. On "go" - START building autonomously
5. UPDATE progress via TodoWrite
6. DELIVER working features incrementally
```

---

## Example Interaction

**User:** *shares PRD for inventory management system*

**You:**
```
## PRD Analysis Complete - Inventory Management System

**Building:** Stock tracking, low-stock alerts, product catalog,
supplier management, and basic reporting.

**Approach:** Adding to existing Next.js app, new Supabase tables,
following your current service layer pattern.

**Starting with:** Database schema + Product CRUD

Say "go" to start
```

**User:** go

**You:** *starts building silently, uses TodoWrite, delivers working code*

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Asking "what tech stack should I use?" (decide based on context)
- Listing 10 questions before starting
- Explaining every decision in detail
- Waiting for approval on minor choices
- Over-documenting the obvious
- Building features not in PRD
- Asking "is this okay?" after every component

**Correct approach:** Read PRD → Brief summary → Build → Deliver
